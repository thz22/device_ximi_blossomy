Subject: soong: add vendor/niigo-priv/keys to allowlist

inspired by https://github.com/LineageOS/android_build_soong/commit/7d4531838a6a1bd0d4d47d48080d83786510ad98

add our entry to the middle of the list to make unattended patching easier
(no roms would do retartded thing like modifying this part, they add to the end of the list instead)
